        <h3>g'day,</h3><br>
        <p>
            as most of you know, i'm currently working on another startup, this time a serious one, the current project is taking up most of my time, usually about ~10 hours on weekdays, and ~16 hours on weekends. <br><br>so far i've seen more people join the project than combined schoolconvers + startupconvo, which is really big for me considering how much time i spent working every single day. <br><br>i don't want to miss this chance and have decided to stop contributing to open source projects, i've decided to put an end to my goal of working at apple, and instead persue something i dreamt of doing. <br><br>if you wanna connect with me, then use my clubhouse account: <a href="https://clubhouse.com/@navthenugget" target="_blank">https://clubhouse.com/@navthenugget</a><br><br>
            my twitter account is maintained by someone else, thus, all dms will be ignored unless initiated from my end. once i've something pleasing to show, i'll update this website.
        </p><br><br>
        cheers,<br>
