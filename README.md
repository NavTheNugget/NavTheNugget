# Update 12 September 2021.

Peak-a-boo ðŸ‘»!

Since my NDA expired yesterday... I did sell SchoolConvers and StartupConvo to two different companies, and started work on another startup, well, it was a startup, it has grown beyond the scale I could ever imagine: hint: 25 times the scale of schoolconvers and startupconvo combined.

I've hired 3 full-time employees, the codebase at the moment is over 1 million lines of code, we're currently working on a couple of more projects within the startup. Still waiting for the right time to release it the public, hopefully in a month, I would come back here, and update the README, finally publicly releasing my next big startup.

That's not the big update though, I've been working on two startups. This is the first startup, and the second startup is directly being funded from the first one: Founder & CEO at both of them, and... it's not related to software at all, it's related to computers, but, not software, something I always wanted to do, and I feel like it's the right time to progress towards that direction.

Cheers,

Nav :)
