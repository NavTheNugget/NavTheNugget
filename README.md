# NavTheNugget
Hey There! I am Nav or NavTheNugget, I am a teenage programmer, I code after school and sometimes before school as well. I have been coding since the age of eight, my first programming language was C. Then I learned C++ and Then Java and then Python. I recently learned Javascript and Typescript and now develop Web Apps using React, Typescript and Express.

## 2014 - 2019
From 8 Years to 13 Years

### Game Development
I have basic knowledge of how computer graphics work, I have made several render engines, which are now long gone in old external SSDs. I used C++, GLFW and GLEW for my render engines.

### Networking Engines
I have also abstracted networking layers of Winsock and Unix Sockets and integrated the Networking Engine which was capable of transmitting both TCP and UDP Socket Connections into my own game engines at points.

### Web Development
I have recently started developing Web Apps, Making complex architectures which were out of my comfort zone, programming APIs, React Apps, etc. This is the time where I actually started becoming a pain in the ass for my teacher(some people know who the teacher is), by making websites about him and completely making a joke out of the assignments.

## 2020 - Present
From 14 Years to Present(Nearly 15 in May)

### Backend Development
Since I moved to Australia, I started the process to quit Gamedev and Move onto developing APIs, Database Management, Automating this process, etc. During this time I started learning Javascript, Typescript, Python3, and Rust. I built my first API in NodeJS By the Start of 2020. I moved onto developing APIs for my previous apps to move all the logic from the frontend to the backend, decreasing the risk of client-side manipulation.

### Frontend Development
After I finished off with some first few basic backend projects, I started developing Frontend Applications. I started off by learning React, Angular(Didn't Enjoy Learning), and Svelte(Same as Angular). I started developing client side applications with React. 

### Full Stack Development
I slowly began transitioning from Backend to Frontend and then to Full Stack Development with PostgreSQL, Typescript, Express, NodeJS, and React. It was at this time I started developing my first real High Quality Full Stack Applications. I started improving my Frontend Design Skills, Developed some wireframes, prototypes. Finally around my Birthday(22 May), I started developing my first true project, SchoolConvers. 

#### 22 May 2020 - 30 Novemeber 2020: SchoolConvers
SchoolConvers is a Forum for School Students and Teachers. I initially started developing this project in NodeJS, Express, and Django. Once I was done with backend, I felt confident with Typescript, I ditched Django for React. I completed the frontend design in 7 Days and Moved onto the Logic. I used Redux with React. I used Google OAuth for Authentication. I finished and released this project on 30 November 2020, After Weeks of Work, Moving my focus from School to SchoolConvers. The development journey was fun, after weeks I had something ready. I released the project on 30 Novemeber 2020, the project had 7 upvotes on ProductHunt, 15 on Reddit and 8 Likes on Facebook. Not Much, this has been my most. I ended up pulling down this project on 28 January 2021, since schools are really hard to convince, and there was no way I could monitise this project.

### iOS Development
After completing SchoolConvers and making a decision to pull this project down, I started sketching out the plan for my next project, I wanted to get into Mobile Development, I first started programming my next app in React Native with Expo, I wanted to give my app a Native Feel which was pretty hard with React Native and Expo. I decided to stop developing my next project with React Native and Expo, but, instead I used SwiftUI and Natively programmed this app. I used the same tech stack for the backend. Since the start of my School Holidays I went onto work on this project Full Time, 14 Hours+ in a Day, comprimising everything I could ever imagine. This app got rejected by apple 6 times. I ended up releasing the app on 27 January 2021. I released this app on ProductHunt, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Many other Platforms. More information about this startup down below.
#### 14 December 2020 - Present: StartupConvo
StartupConvo is a Startup Discovery Platform, StartupConvo comes in with a built-in leaderboard and an unbiased algorithm, giving a fair chance to every single startup ever listed on this platform. I coded this purely in SwiftUI, using a little bit of UIKit for some parts. This app uses Sign in with Apple for Authentication, This app has a Verification System, Leaderboard System and an unbiased startup, preventing startups from getting overshadowed by big businesses.

## Conclusion
This is basically what I have learned in programming so far, this repo actually contains my own personal website where I make a complete joke out of myself to make people laugh... I have actually added a few social media links at the end of the web page, so be sure to check them out, to see how big of a dumbass I am.
