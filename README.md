# NavTheNugget
Hey There! I am Nav or NavTheNugget, I am a teenage programmer, I code after school and sometimes before school as well. I have been coding since the age of since and my first programming language was C. Then I learned C++ and Then Java and then Python. I recently learned Javascript and Typescript and now develops Web Apps using React, Typescript and Express.

## Game Development
I have basic knowledge of how computer graphics work, I have made several render engines, which are now long gone in old external SSDs. I used C++, GLFW and GLEW for my render engines.

## Networking Engines
I have also abstracted networking layers of Winsock and Unix Sockets and integrated the Networking Engine which was capable of transmitting both TCP and UDP Socket Connections into my own game engines at points.

## Web Development
I have recently started developing Web Apps, Making complex architectures which were out of my comfort zone, programming APIs, React Apps, etc. This is the time where I actually started becoming a pain in the ass for my teacher(some people know who the teacher is), by making websites about him and completely making a joke out of the assignments.

## Conclusion
This is basically what I have learned in programming so far, this repo actually contains my own personal website where I make a complete joke out of myself to make people laugh... I have actually added a few social media links at the end of the web page, so be sure to check them out, to see how big of a dumbass I am myself.

### Project ideas
Down Below is the List of Project Ideas that I came up with in 2 minutes because I am lazy, I would keep adding ideas to this list:
##### Multiplayer Game
Softwares to Build
- UDP Server
Programming Language of Choice: C++
- Game
Tools that can be used: Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, OpenGL, SDL2, LWJGL, literally any game engine or framework.

**Deploy**
Deploy the Server on a VPS Server, choose from list down below:
- High Frequency Compute($6) from [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/products/high-frequency-compute/)
- [Digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/)


Any VPS can be used, these are the ones I recommend for this project.
